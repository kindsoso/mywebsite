&lt;p&gt;In summer 2019, I participated in the IBM Call for Code competition as a member of the Bank of China team. The competition looked for innovative ideas on disaster relief issues. We were tackling the inefficient relief supply distribution, a problem caused by the lack of transparent information and trust. When a natural disaster happens, information acquisition between two parties that need and provide resources rely on traditional media. There are often information barriers between each other that lack a resource scheduling scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;methods&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure mutual trust, blockchain was used in our solution as it has a transparent mechanism. Blockchain technology has the benefits of increased transparency in data shared on the network, contributing to enhanced trust among different organizations. During the development process, I used the Go language to implement chaincode, a “smart contract” that handled the demand and supply matching logic under the Hyperledger Fabric framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on blockchain, we built functions such as information release and evaluation systems. In addition, we formed the scheme of a matchmaking system to match the disaster-stricken party with the relief provider. The design also included a feedback mechanism for the participant organizations, and the results would affect the supply distribution priority of the next matchmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;results&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the development and research of the Global Aim Match System, the team formed a systematic disaster relief chain solution that would increase transparency and boost the efficiency of disaster assistance. Our project placed among the top five in the Greater China region.&lt;/p&gt;
